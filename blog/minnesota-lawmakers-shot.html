        <h2>Immediate Response and Reactions</h2>
        <p>In the aftermath of the shooting, Minnesota Governor [insert name] released a statement expressing sadness and outrage at the violence. "We must come together as a community to demand change and ensure that our representatives can do their jobs without fear," he said.
